# Chapter 1 Computer Networks And The Internet 

## Overview

### 1.1 What Is The Internet? 

#### Questions To Answer:
- What is difference between host and end system? List several of each. 
hosts and end systems are the same thing. "things connected to a network"

- The word Protocol is often used to descripbe diplomatic relations. How does wikipedia describe protocols? 
  - agreed set of communication standards. Set of rules/manners. 

- Why are standards imoportant for protocols?
  - too many moving parts. If we have standards, as long as we implements the interfaces, we can plug in and play into a multitude of systems 



- Nuts-and-bolts description
  - computer networks that connects billions of devices (computers/games/stoplights etc...)
  - hosts = end systems (computers and devices)
  - communication links (physical medium) 
  - packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)(warehouses organizing packets to end destinations)
  - routers and switches == two most common types of packet switches 
  - Transmission Control Protocol & IP == two most important protocols

- Services Description 
  - infrastructure that provides services to applications
  - applications run on end systems, not on the infratructure. 
  - applicatoins use the infrastructure to allow applications to communicate 
  - socket interface == how internet expects end systems to use the infrastructure (alice, the letter, 'postal service interface')

- What is a protocol? 
  - 'collective set of rules / manners' 
  - if we all play by the same rules, then we'll know what to expect from each other
  - 'send and receive messages in known/understandable formats' 

### 1.2 The Network Edge 
- Access Networks 
- Physical Media 

### 1.3 The Network Core 
- Packet Switching 
- Circuit Switching 
- A Network Of Networks 

### 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks 
- Overview of Delay 
  - Types Of Delay
  - Processing Delay 
  - Queuing Delay 
  - Transmission Delay 
  - Propagation Delay 
  - Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay 
- Queuing Delay And Packet Loss 
  - Packet Loss 
- Ent-To-End Delay 
  - Traceroute 
  - End system, Application and Other Delays 
- Throughput in Computer Networks 

### 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models 

##### Questions To Answer 
- List Five tasks a layer can perform. Is it possible for one or more of these tasks to be performed by multiple layers?

- What are the five layers? What are their principal responsibilities?

- What is an application-layer message? A transport layer segment? 
  - a "packet" 
  - at each layer, the "thing" they are dealing with gets a different name 

- Which layers in the internet protocol stack does a router process? 
    - link-layer 
- Which layers does a link-layer switch process? (network and physical, link))
- Which layers does a host process (all five) 


- Layered Architecture
  > Airport analogy (ticket, baggage check, board, takeoff, land, deplane, baggage claim) 
  >Each layer has its own service it provies, either at the airport, or in the air  
  - Application Layer 
    - HTTP(web document requests), SMTP (emails), FTP(file transfers) 
    - translation of web url to 32 bit network address (DNS) 
    - packet in application layer === message 

  - Transport Layer 
    - transports application messages between endpoints 
    - TCP/UDP == two protocols 
    - TCP == connection-oriented. 
      - guarenteed transmission (will retry if not confirm)
      - breaks long messages into shorter segments 
      - congestion control mechanism (will throttle if network clogged) 
    - UDP === connectionless 
      - no confirmation/throttling/flow control 
    - packet in transport layer === segment 

  - Network Layer 
    - packets in network layer === datagrams
    - moves datagrams from one network host to another 
    - transport layer gives segment and destination (like postal service with letter/addess)
    - IP protocol - defines fields inthe datagram 

  - Link Layer 
    - moves packets from one router to another between networks 
    - link -> router which passes up to network then back down to link to -> next router
    - Ethernet, WIFI protocols 
    - packets in link layer === frames 

  - Physical Layer 
    - moves bits from frames across 
    - idk this section is like one sentence 

  - The OSI Model 
    - Model that didnt get accepted as a standard
    - contains two additional layers: 
    - presentation 
      -provide services to allow applications to interpret the meaning of data exchanged
    - session 
      - sync of data exchange (???) 

- Encapsulation 
  - on their path from end host to end host, packets dont have to pass through all layers 
  - each layer has a header field and a payload field 



### 1.6 Networks Under Attack
- The Bad Guys can put malware into your host via the internet 
- The Bad Guys can attack servers and network infrastructure 
- The Bad Guys can sniff packets 
- The Bad Guys can masquerade as someone you trust 

### 1.7 History Of Computer Networking and the Internet
- Development of Packet Switching (1961-1972)
  - 1960's - idea of "packet switching" became the way people  were thinking about how to transmit data 
  - modeled afte how telephone company used switches 
  
- Proprietary Networks and Internetworking (1972-1980)
- Proliferation Of Networks (1980-1990)
- Internet Explosion (1990s) 
- New Millennium
