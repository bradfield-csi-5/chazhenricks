# Notes 

- `8.8.8.8` == "recursive resolver" === cacheing server. 
- Lots of them around | typically your ISP
- Incentivized to replicate/cache DNS records in these recursive

Recursive resolver ==> calls ==> Root server 
- we ask Root server for the NameSpace server for the TLD only (.com/.edu/.ly etc...)
- root servers respinsible for knowing about the TLD Name Servers
- root will return with Name Server for the TLD 

Recursive resolver ==> calls ==> TLD Server 
- we ask the TLD for the actual ip address 
- will get back some Name Servers for any subdomains managed by wikipedia 

Recursive Resolver ==> calls => Name Server 
- we then ask the Name Server for wikipedia.org and get back the ip address
